# 2.1 AI Behavior & Capability Specification

**Component:** R.E.X. Intelligence Engine  

---

## 1. Capability Scope

### 1.1 What the AI IS Allowed to Do
*   **Execute Read-Only Commands:** `dir`, `list processes`, `read file` (within User directories).
*   **Launch Applications:** Any executable found in the Start Menu or System Path.
*   **Control Media:** Play/Pause/Next via system media keys.

### 1.2 What the AI is NOT Allowed to Do (Hard Limits)
*   **Modify System Files:** No write access to `C:\Windows`, `C:\Program Files`.
*   **Registry Edits:** Blocked from `reg add` or `reg delete`.
*   **Remote Connections:** Cannot initiate SSH or RDP connections to other machines.
*   **Self-Modification:** Cannot rewrite its own source code or `server.exe` binary.

## 2. Supported Intents
R.E.X. processes user input into structured "Intents" via the Gemini LLM.

### 1.1 Conversational Intents
*   **General Chat:** Casual conversation, personality-driven responses (Persona: "REX-like").
*   **Information Retrieval:** Answering questions based on general knowledge (e.g., "Who won the 1994 World Cup?").
*   **Creative Writing:** Drafting emails, poems, or code snippets.

### 1.2 Tool-Use Intents (Functional)
*   **`launch_app`:** Opens an application by name (e.g., "Open Spotify").
*   **`system_control`:** Executes shell commands (e.g., "Shutdown", "Volume Up").
*   **`search_web`:** Performs a Google search (if enabled).

## 2. Tool Access Boundaries
R.E.X. operates with the same privileges as the user running the application.
*   **Filesystem:** Read/Write access to the User profile. Restricted from core System folders unless run as Admin.
*   **Network:** Outbound access allowed (HTTPS). Inbound ports restricted to localhost (Socket.IO).

## 3. Error Handling & Fallback
*   **Unclear Intent:** If the user's request is ambiguous, R.E.X. will ask for clarification ("I didn't quite catch that, sir.").
*   **Tool Failure:** If a tool fails (e.g., App not found), R.E.X. reports the error verbally ("I could not find 'Photoshop' installed.").
*   **Network Offline:** If Gemini is unreachable, R.E.X. responds with a pre-cached offline error message.

## 4. Safety & Refusal Rules
*   **Harmful Content:** R.E.X. inherits Gemini's safety filters regarding hate speech, harassment, and dangerous content.
*   **Destructive Commands:** R.E.X. is programmed (via system prompt) to refuse explicit requests to "Delete System32" or perform obviously malicious damage, though the underlying shell access exists.
