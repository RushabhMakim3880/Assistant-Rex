## 1. Data Collection Inventory

| Data Type | Description | Storage Location | Retention |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Voice Audio** | User speech input | RAM (Buffer) -> Cloud (Gemini) | Transient (Processed & Discarded) |
| **Transcripts** | Text of user speech | RAM / Local Logs | Session-based / Log file (7 days) |
| **System Stats** | CPU/RAM usage | RAM (Real-time) | Not stored |
| **API Keys** | Gemini API Credentials | Windows Env Vars | User Managed |

## 2. Data Flow & Encryption
*   **Local:** Data in RAM is unencrypted (volatile).
*   **In-Transit:** All communication with Google Gemini API is encrypted via **TLS 1.2+ (HTTPS)**.
*   **At-Rest:** R.E.X. does not store a persistent database of conversations in this version. Logs are text-based and stored in `%APPDATA%`.

## 3. Cloud Processing (Third-Party)
*   **Processor:** Google Cloud (Gemini API).
*   **Usage:** Audio/Text is sent *only* when the wake word is detected or the user manually engages the assistant.
*   **Privacy:** Refer to [Google Generative AI Privacy Terms](https://policies.google.com/privacy). R.E.X. acts as a client.

## 4. User Rights & Deletion
*   **Local Logs:** Users can manually delete `%APPDATA%\assistant-rex\main_process_log.txt`.
*   **API Data:** Users can revoke the API Key at any time to cut off cloud access.
## 5. Encryption Standards & Access Control
*   **Encryption:** 
    *   **In-Transit:** TLS 1.3 (HTTPS) for all Gemini API calls.
    *   **At-Rest:** File system relies on Windows BitLocker (if enabled by OS).
*   **Access Control:**
    *   **User-Only:** R.E.X. runs as the logged-in User. Other users on the same machine cannot access the live process memory.
    *   **No Remote Access:** The Socket.IO server binds strictly to `127.0.0.1`, preventing LAN access.
