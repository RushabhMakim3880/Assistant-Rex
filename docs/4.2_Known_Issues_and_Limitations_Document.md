# 4.2 Known Issues & Limitations Document

**Version:** 1.1.0  

---

## 1. Installation & launch
*   **ISSUE-001 (API Key):** Users must manually set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in Environment Variables. The app will launch but fail to respond silently (or log errors) if missing.
*   **ISSUE-002 (SmartScreen):** Windows SmartScreen warns about "Unknown Publisher" because the installer is not signed with an EV Certificate ($300+/yr cost).

## 2. Audio & Recognition
*   **ISSUE-003 (Barge-In):** R.E.X. may listen to its own voice if speaker volume is too high (Echo Cancellation is software-only).
*   **ISSUE-004 (Ambient Noise):** High background noise can prevent VAD (Voice Activity Detection) from untriggering, causing long "Listening" states.

## 3. OS Integration
*   **ISSUE-005 (Fullscreen Apps):** DirectX exclusive fullscreen games may obscure the R.E.X. HUD overlay. Recommend using "Borderless Windowed" mode in games.
*   **ISSUE-006 (Admin Tasks):** R.E.X. cannot perform Admin-level tasks (e.g., "Install Driver") unless the main application is explicitly Run as Administrator.

## 4. Hardware Constraints
*   **AVX Instructions:** The `tensorflow` (used by MediaPipe) binary requires a CPU with AVX instruction set support. Older CPUs (Pre-2012) may crash on backend startup.
