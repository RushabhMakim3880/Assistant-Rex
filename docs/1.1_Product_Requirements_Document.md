## 1. Product Vision
To provide a sophisticated, enterprise-grade desktop AI assistant that integrates seamlessly with the Windows operating system, offering voice-controlled automation, real-time system monitoring, and intelligent tool execution. R.E.X. acts as a proactive "Executive Assistant" for power users, developers, and IT professionals, reducing context switching and enabling hands-free productivity.

## 2. Problem Statement
Current AI tools are primarily sandboxed within web browsers, lacking direct context of the local machine and the ability to execute system-level tasks. Users suffer from "context switching" fatigue, constantly moving between their work environment and an AI chat window.

## 3. Target Personas
*   **The Power User:** Requires sophisticated automation, system monitoring, and hands-free control.
*   **The Developer:** Needs an assistant that understands code context, can run terminal commands, and integrates with their workflow.
*   **The Executive:** Values a premium, polished interface ("Iron Man" aesthetic) with reliable, concise information retrieval.

## 4. Use Cases
*   **Primary:**
    *   **Voice Automation:** Launching apps, controlling media, managing windows via natural language.
    *   **System Monitoring:** Real-time visualization of CPU/GPU/Network metrics.
    *   **Intelligent Query:** Answering complex questions using the latest LLM capabilities (Gemini).
*   **Secondary:**
    *   **Generative Tasks:** Creating emails, code snippets, or drafting documents.
    *   **Visual Analysis:** Analyzing screen content (Vision capabilities) for context-aware assistance.

## 5. Functional Requirements
*   **FR-01: Core Intelligence:** The system must utilize Google Gemini (v1beta) for high-fidelity natural language understanding and generation.
*   **FR-02: Voice Interface:** The system must support always-listening wake-word detection ("REX" or "Rex") with low-latency Voice Activity Detection (threshold < 100ms).
*   **FR-03: Visual Feedback:** The UI must provide immediate visual feedback for system states (Listening, Thinking, Speaking) via the "Pulse Core" visualizer.
*   **FR-04: OS Integration:** The system must execute shell commands, manage path variables, and interact with the file system securely.
*   **FR-05: Modularity:** The architecture must support distinct "skills" or "tools" (e.g., Audio Control, App Launching) that can be enabled/disabled.

*   **Offline Capability:** Core UI and limited voice command parsing must function offline; LLM requests handled gracefully with "Unable to connect" error.

## 7. Constraints
*   **Hardware:** Requires AVX2 compatible CPU for TensorFlow/MediaPipe.
*   **OS Versions:** Windows 10 (2004+) or Windows 11.
*   **Permissions:** Run-as-User default; Admin required only for system-wide changes.
*   **Legal:** Must comply with Google GenAI Safety Policies.

## 8. Out-of-Scope
*   **Mobile Support:** iOS/Android versions are explicitly out of scope.
*   **Mac/Linux:** No support planned for v1.x series.
*   **Home Automation:** Direct IoT control (Zigbee/Z-Wave) not supported without external bridges.

## 9. Success Metrics
*   **Technical:** < 1% Application Crash Rate; < 2s Average Response Time (TTFT).
*   **User:** Daily Active Usage > 30 mins; Successful Command Execution Rate > 90%.
*   **Stability:** Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) > 100 hours.
