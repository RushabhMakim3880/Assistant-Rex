# 5.2 Threat Model (STRIDE)

**Asset:** R.E.X. Desktop Assistant  

---

## 1. Spoofing Identity
*   **Threat:** An attacker plays a recording of the user's voice to trigger commands ("REX, unlock the door").
*   **Mitigation:** Voice Match (Future) or confirmation for sensitive actions. Current mitigation Rely on physical access requirements.

## 2. Tampering with Data
*   **Threat:** Malicious modification of the `rex.py` script or the `exe` to inject malware.
*   **Mitigation:** The production build is compiled to a binary (`server.exe`), preventing script kiddie tampering. Full code signing (planned) would prevent binary modification.

## 3. Repudiation
*   **Threat:** User denies performing a valid action command.
*   **Mitigation:** Local Logs record every recognized command and tool execution with timestamps.

## 4. Information Disclosure
*   **Threat:** `GEMINI_API_KEY` leaked from environment variables.
*   **Mitigation:** Keys are not stored in the codebase or config files. They remain in User Environment variables, protected by Windows User Account permissions.

## 5. Denial of Service
*   **Threat:** Excessive background noise prevents the assistant from functioning.
*   **Mitigation:** Local VAD (Voice Activity Detection) filters low-volume noise. Reset VAD capability if stuck in "Listening".

## 6. Elevation of Privilege
*   **Threat:** LLM tricking the system into executing admin commands (`rm -rf /`).
*   **Mitigation:** Running as Standard User limits damage scope to User Profile only.

## 7. Residual Risks
*   **Risk:** Zero-day exploit in `ffmpeg` or `python` libraries.
*   **Mitigation:** Regular dependency updates (Monthly).
*   **Acceptance:** Accepted risk for local desktop software.
