Located in the center of the UI, the Pulse Core serves as the primary status indicator:
*   **Cyan (Pulse):** Idle / Listening. R.E.X. is waiting for commands.
*   **Purple (Fast Pulse):** Thinking. The AI is processing your request.
*   **Red (Glow):** Speaking. R.E.X. is responding vocally.

### 2.2 System Monitors

## 3. Voice Interaction
R.E.X. is designed to be hands-free.

### 3.2 Starting & Stopping
*   **Start:** Launch via Desktop Shortcut or Start Menu.
*   **Stop:** Right-click the R.E.X. Tray Icon (near the system clock) and select **"Quit R.E.X"**.

## 5. Known Limitations
*   **Full Screen Apps:** R.E.X. generally stays on top, but some exclusive-fullscreen games may hide the overlay.
*   **Sensitive Data:** While R.E.X. processes data insecurely (Voice -> Text), avoid dictating highly sensitive passwords or financial data if you are in a public environment.
*   **Context:** R.E.X. currently has limited "memory" of past conversations compared to web-based ChatGPT (resets on restart in current version).
